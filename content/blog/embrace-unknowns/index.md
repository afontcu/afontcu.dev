title: Embrace unknowns
description: Once upon a time in 1869, a russian scientist named Mendeleev was obsessed with ordering all elements present in nature. The typical russian scientist obsession.

For that, he wrote down a card for each known element (63 by that time) and attempted to sort them out by several criteria.

Mendeleev noticed that the properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a periodic way. He arranged them so that groups of similar elements fell into vertical columns in his table.

This is how Mendeleev came up with the infamous Period Table of the Elements.

However… things were a bit off. Some elements did not exactly fit, and some gaps were impossible to fill.

The scientist, then, made a bold assumption. He left some empty spaces in the grid, and pushed elements to the appropriate column. He assumed he was missing something. That allowed him to predict that future elements would be discovered that would fill the spots.

He turned out to be right.

## So what?

"So what", you might be thinking. "I know you. There's a hidden software metaphor somewhere, right?".

Of course. We're getting there.

The interesting part about Mendeleev's story is that he noticed something didn't add up given his current knowledge. By embracing the unknown in his theory, he was able to predict the future. Or, well, allow the future to drive his theory.

He could predict other elements *because* he left spaces open in his periodic table for them. The model was valid *because* of its gaps.

He didn't expect to get everything right upfront. It was impossible.

He moved from a **complex scenario** to a **complicated** one.

In a complex domain "cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers" (this was shamelessly copied&pasted [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)).

In a complicated scenario, instead, there's a predictable solution. It may take a while to get there, but it exists.


## An example

I love when, in the midst of a planning session, a business expert says "*Oh, good question. Hadn't thought of that*". That's great, because it means it is time to stop planning (I hate it).

Right at that point we understand we work on a complex system, where uncertainty is unavoidable..

This is essentially what we do.

And you know, asking for clarification is the automatic response. But I refuse to believe it is the best one. Instead, such unknowns ask for feedback (the shorter, the better) from the users, the system, the context, or a combination of them.

Mendeleev did not ask for clarifications (maybe he did – I wasn't there and I don't know that much about that man, to be honest). He assumed some parts were missing and used the gaps to build up the knowledge.

We are also in a complex zone. We know the direction, so we should take small steps, get there, and then look back. By getting this feedback loops, you can expect two different outcomes: it works (*yay*!) or you change direction (*yay*!, too. You got there the cheapest possible way).

In complex and chaotic zones, we’re constantly experimenting and can’t plan what’s going to happen, making an estimate is impossible.

We need to determine whether if we're discussing a **complicated** problem or a **complex** one.

Complicated problems have solutions, but you might need some expertise to make them happen. Several solutions exist, actually, so there are multiple good practices.
