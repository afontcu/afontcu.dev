That feature won't be useful.

Users won't understand that new option.

This piece of code is not gonna work.

Not a positive point of view, huh? Well, I grant you that.

Let's face it: things don't work as expected, and we usually find out too late.

## And since bad things will happen…

What is the best way to discover them? And by "best" I mean best effort-certainty ratio.

We could be optimists and hope that…

…that this six-month project is gonna be delivered on time and people are gonna love it.

…that that feature is easy enough, and we'll deliver it next week no doubt.

…that these nested `if` statements will work as expected and I won't miss any edge case.

Or I could see things the other way around.


## What if we assume we're gonna be wrong?

Instead of hoping we're right, we could…

…admit that we don't know if that feature is gonna be useful.

…admit that we don't know how to code that feature.

…assume that our ideas, projects, and visions are built upon **assumptions**.

Heck, we're wrong even when we think we're right! [Here's a list of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that prove we don't even notice when we're wrong.


## Take the red pill

Now, this seems trivial but it changes everything. The starting point when building software products are **the assumptions you're making**.

## An assumption is not an assumption

A [calorie is not a calorie](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/a-calorie-is-not-a-calorie/), and an assumption is not an assumption. There will always be assumptions, but they all are not the same.

Some are critical. If we're wrong, we're screwed.

Others are small nuances that won't derail the initiative or the feature we're working on.

Some assumptions can (should) be explored and solved. But most of the times this is not possible, and we need to settle with a higher degree of confidence on that assumption. That's good and what we aim for.

We can't figure everything out at the beginning. Actually, I can't think of a worst approach to tackle [a complex problem](https://afontcu.dev/embrace-unknowns/).

Instead, the goal is to **increase the confidence on critical assumptions**.

If everything is uncertain, there's only one thing to do.

Look for **quick feedback that proves us wrong** (or right).


## But but but.

Keep the cost of change as low as possible. Also, learn what's hard to change and what's not.

As a front-end engineer, for instance, I know what things are easy to tweak on a UI and what things are not. There's no point in debating over a small detail for a long period of time if changing it is fast and simple.

However, I want quick feedback on my assumptions, even when I code. I assume I got the requirements right, and that I wrote the code I intended to write. And what's the best way to increase the confidence on those assumptions? You know the answer: to write automated tests.

## "What can we do to get some quick feedback on this?"

That's the powerful question.

There's always risk associated with the assumptions. The smart move here is to embrace these assumptions and address their risk early in the project/feature.

## In a nutshell

"What could go wrong, here?" is a great starting point when creating software products. And it works in many levels: from a small function, to a bigger feature, to a whole initiative, to a whole quarte goal.

In unveils that we make decisions based on assumptions. And yeah, it is necessary and encourage and the only way to move forward. But it is also dangerous if we aren't aware we're walking on thin ice.

The solution? Find the cheapest, quickest way to reduce the uncertainty until you feel confident enough.
