Harry has a small shoe factory. Yeah, that's Harry. And he's quite good at it, I must say. An excellent small shoe factory manager.

Over time, Harry came to the conclusion that one can measure the factory *productivity*. It's merely the **number of shoes produced by a unit of time**.

If you would make 10 shoes a day and now you produce 15, well, you go faster.

You're more efficient.

More productive.

And there's no turn of the page: you are *always faster* if you end up with 15 shoes a day instead of 10.

Harry can measure its system productivity by looking at the outputs of it (i.e., the shoes) given a set of inputs (i.e., time, raw material, people).

He knows the stuff, and he can measure it. So he's happy. He sleeps well at night. He gets back home every day, kisses his children goodnight, plays at Counter Strike for a bit, and watches Netflix. All good.

But Harry has a brother, Ron. And Ron is not as lucky as Harry.

Because…

## Harry's brother builds software

*(Aaah! Software! Screams and shouts all over the place. Software!).*

Boomer.

— Hey, Harry — says Ron — how come you're so happy? You sleep like a baby. And I can't even… Dunno, can't figure it out at work. I don't know how to measure *how much work* my team's doing, so I can't sleep. And I suck at Counter Strike.

— OK, one step at a time. Do you make shoes? No, you don't. You don't work in a factory. You don't have a physical product, do you? Then you cannot measure as I do.

— Yes, but…

— No buts, Ron. Mmm… Say you work on a movie. The *output* is its length. Does it make any sense to measure its **performance** based on the total amount of minutes?

— Yes, but…

— No buts, Ron. You could measure, for instance, how many tickets are sold. Or the average review score. Those could be easily interpreted as **results**, and it is quite different from measuring *outputs*.

— Oh, so you mean…

— No means, Ron. I'm 100% positive that the metrics you were working with were flawed or could be tempered easily. You track Story Points, you said, right? lol.

— Of course, I do. It's my way of knowing how much work we deliver, so I can track if we perform better or worse. Points help me establish our velocity. The faster, the better.

— Ok. Notice that you are now measuring the play length. I mean, **you're measuring the output of the team**. Lines of code, features, wireframes, story points… team outputs.

I'd go the extra mile: facing the same results, the lesser outputs, the better. You'll see…

## An example

You might have a web form that performs poorly — that is, it has a low conversion rate. You have two development teams, so you ask them to fix it up for you.

After a sprint, **Team #1** comes to you with results. They say: "We've redesigned the form while introducing an analytics system so that we can track user behavior and put in place some A/B testing. We then segmented users depending on some metrics, and it worked. Conversions are now on track. The resulting code is pretty well-organized. We've delivered 45 story points.

So, **Team #2**: "Hey, we noticed the content around the form wasn't quite clear and was poorly-written. We talked to a couple of stakeholders and agreed upon better copies. Then we logged in the CMS, changed the copies, and so far, so good. I guess we delivered 0 story points".

## Results instead of outputs

— You see that, Ron? Both teams get the same result: they boost conversion. But each team has a different velocity. Which one would you pick?

— Yeah, OK, I see… they managed to get the same result while creating less output. So they generated less stuff, too.

— Notice that the second team has an astounding speed: 0. Is it a failure?

— If you put it that way…

— In your software world, you have this [saying about simplicity](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), right?

> **Simplicity** — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.

— OK, you got me, Harry. Let me see if I got it right. **Are you saying a team isn't any "better" because it goes faster?** Because we're not making shoes in a factory?

— This is it.

— ...that it might go faster, but it might end up with the same **results**.

— This is it.

— ...that measuring results instead of velocity is quite more useful.

— This is it.

— ...because in my world, more output means more bugs, more complexity, more defects. More costs. It is like [code was a liability](http://web.archive.org/web/20070420113817/http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/04/16/code-is-a-liability)…

— This is it. [Hard to say it is an asset](http://lesscode.org/2005/09/01/code-is-not-an-asset/), given this point of view. Right?

— …so, **our goal is to cut the total work done (outputs), while maximizing the results?**

— This is it. Fancy a Counter Strike?
