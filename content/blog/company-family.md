It _looks_ like a family, though, doesn’t it? You probably spend more time at work than with your relatives. You celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, victories and defeats. You care for each other.

And yet, saying that a company is your “family” sounds weird to me. And it is _poisonous_ to some extent. Yes, we say so to express the intention of being honest, kind, and supportive of each other.

But do we have to pretend to be a family to achieve that? (_spoiler: no, we don’t_)

**Not every community needs to be your family**. Our family is our first community, but it’s just one.

A company should help you improve your _life-outside-work_, not replace it. It should provide you with the mechanisms to have a great personal life, no matter what.

But the _family mindset_ within a company could be at odds with these goals. If you have two families, you need to please both, and avoid betraying them — This kind of emotional investment isn’t something you should look for.

One of the main differences between a company and a family is that, in general, you cannot quit from it, or choose its members (yes, yes, yes, I know, “yes, but”… bear with me!). You also don’t need to share common goals with your family — they are family after all.

Well, actually. The main difference is that you don’t get paid to be part of a family. Unless your father/brother/uncle/son is the King and you live in the 19th century (oh, wait). But whatever.

## OK, a company is not my family. What is it, then?

**A company is a team**. Usually, a group of teams. And there’s a lot of things to share with teammates.

In a team, people share **goals**, values, organization, strategy, and **understanding**. People can expect some sort of alignment between your personal goals and the direction and vision of the team.

You might call it a tribe — it’s a cohesive group of people.

From an anthropological point of view (and I read half an entry from the Wikipedia about it so you can call me an expert), a _tribe_ is a group of people with a shared ancestral identity. I’m not so sure about the _ancestral_ part, but the “_shared identity and vision_” part kind of sounds like the “_shared goals_” idea outlined above.

And this is enough. And great.

Call it a tribe, call it a clan, call it a team. My point is that family is a different thing, with different implications.

So, whenever you hear “here at <insert company name> we are family”, ask this to yourself. Are they talking about _the good parts_ of a family? Or are they pursuing the kind of commitment you would expect from it?
