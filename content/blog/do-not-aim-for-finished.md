do not aim for finished

aim for the best combination of effort and provided value

leave your developer pride aside

There's always something you can remove.

Remember, it is an iteration.

You're finding the best combination of effort and provided value.

A shitton of effort is hard to match. No value is also meaningless.

## Vertically over horizontally

Cool designs in Figma are really cool. Nice rounded corners.

Amazing database schemas are also stunning. Wow, such foreign key. Amazing triggers.

The design might be perfect. So might the schema.

None of them are done. None of them are… valuable by themselves.





semblant a TDD

## But it ends up being done

Sure. I'll just quote Kent Beck here – the occasion has yet to come where I'm able to express something better than Mr. Beck:

"*Alternative to estimates: do the most important thing until either it ships or it is no longer the most important thing*". ([source](https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/634741725047615489))

I'd humbly add "or until someone stops paying you money for".

But yeah, he has a point.
