150 years ago,

In 1869, there was this russian scientist how attempted to organise the elements that we find in nature. You know, the kind of things russian scientists do.

For that, wrote down a card for each known element (XX, by that time) and attempted to sort them out. He kept on rearranging until he noticed that if he ordered them by atomic weight, some patterns emerged.

The magic is that some elements did not fit. The scientist then made a bold and risky decisions: he left empty spaces in the grid, and pushed elements to fit the pattern he just discovered. He embraced the unknown and assumed lack of knowledge. Easier said than done.

This is how Mendeleev came up with the infamous Period Table of the Elements (or Periodic System, as he called it).

## moraleja

What can we learn from Mendeleev?

I'm not gonna go into details (I just read all that on Wikipedia), but

But something didn't add up. H



the idea was that element properties were periodic, meaning that

So, it's theory was universal. Gaps were there not to fight against the theory.

Instead, ga

He could predict the discovery of other elements *because* left spaces open in his periodic table for them. The model was complete *because*  of its gap, because of its lack of knowledge.

embrace unknowns and let them complete your theories, instead of fighting against them
