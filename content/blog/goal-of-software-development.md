Why would anyone pay for it? We programmers are picky. We want newer tools each day. We want to work on what we please. We want to go to conferences.

Well, one of the advantages of having people like us is that we might produce software.

And software has an interesting goal.

## The goal of software development

*(Did I just write a subtitle using the post title? You bet I did).*

The main goal of software is to **reduce the lead time to deliver business value**.

("Lead Time" as in "the time elapsed between identifying a business opportunity and providing the tools to fulfill it". Or [this](https://leanandkanban.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/lead-time-vs-cycle-time/).).

Also, the goal of software development is **to do so in a sustainable pace**. Not once, not for a week, but for an indeterminate amount of time. That's critical.

## The goal is not producing software

In an ideal world more software always leads to more business value. But we all know that's not true.

More software means more maintainability, more defects, less understanding.

Do you see the **paradox** there? To provide more value, we'd need to reduce the amount of code.

We'd need to produce less of what we just agreed that gives us value.

Writing code is in conflict with its main goal. I feel this is quite uncommon in other worlds: it doesn't happen in a factory.

## Code is not an asset

Using that perspective, code cannot be an asset, right? It isn't something you want to pile up, to have a stock.

**Code is the cost of getting that business impact**. It is what gets in the way between us and creating that value.

It is just the best way we could come up with – for now.

"Wait, what?" you might ask. Well, there are several "costs" involved when creating software. The cost of writing it. Of maintaining it. Even the cost of understanding past code. The **opportunity cost** of writing a piece of software instead of that other one.

## This is / This is not

Software development is not about moving Jira tickets. I wish software development had nothing to do with Jira, actually.

Software development is not about over-engineering stuff and feeling smart about it because *it is cool* and then you can look at people over the shoulder.

Software development is about **sustainably reduce lead time to business impact.**
