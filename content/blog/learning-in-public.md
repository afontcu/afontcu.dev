“Expand my brain, learning juice!” — Homer Simpson, poet (Episode s17e06)

When [I started this newsletter](https://medium.com/@afontcu/have-you-ever-sent-your-own-newsletter-51e22f82f949), I stated that **Learning in Public** was one of the main reasons for doing so.

But, why?

And more important: Is it worth it?

When I was 15, I started my own personal blog. It was hosted on Blogger, and it was a collection of random, funny, and exciting stuff I stumbled upon. Nothing fancy. Yet, I loved two things:

First, that I enjoyed creating websites. Blogger had this ugly(?) XML-like language to tweak its blogs, but I felt mighty changing colors and sizes. 13 years later, here I am.

The second thing I loved _(and right to the point of this newsletter, focus Adrià goddammit)_ was that I _knew_ stuff because I had shared them. I was aware of things, and I remembered them because I took the time of writing them down and creating the post.

This feeling was powerful. Do you mean I get to do what I like **while** learning interesting stuff? Shut up and take my money (I was 15, so yeah, good luck taking _all_ my money).

I’ve had several blogs afterward (Geeks.cat, which disappeared. And now my [account on Medium](http://medium.com/@afontcu)). The idea, however, remained the same: **forcing yourself to share is the best way to learn a topic**. I’d go even further: the only way of getting to know something is by being able to explain it using simple words.

I have changed the format (now I started [giving conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3yx_sFyoUo&feature=youtu.be)). The format is not important. A blog, a short talk, a video, a podcast, an answer to a forum, whatever. As long as you share, you improve.

The goal shouldn’t be “to reach as many people as possible”. That’s a quite lovely side effect. Yet, the goal should be to help your future self.

## Start simple

Do you read cool stuff online? Share it on your team’s Slack, on Twitter. [Curate a post list](https://calidae.blog/tagged/food-for-thought) and publish it (it’s so damn easy).

The wheel never stops turning.

Then, you might see the benefit of explaining something. It could be a short blog post, a code snippet shared on Codesandbox, a cool design on Dribbble, a lightning talk in your company.

Once you started to do so, why not trying to submit a talk to some cool conference? I kept it simple the first time. I spoke at [Barcelona Crafters](http://scbcn.github.io), who wanted the conference to be a safe playground for new speakers. This week I gave a talk again at [Modern Web Event](https://mosaic.uoc.edu/modern-web-event/), and next week at [Commit](https://2018.commit-conf.com/). It’s just another way of sharing.

And this, folks, is the main reason behind this newsletter. It’s just another channel I wanted to explore. The more people I reach, the better — it might mean more feedback, so more learning! The goal is improving.

Go for it.
