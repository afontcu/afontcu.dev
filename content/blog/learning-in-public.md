“Expand my brain, learning juice!” — Homer Simpson, poet (Episode s17e06)

When [I started my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/afontcu), I stated that **Learning in Public** was one of the main reasons for doing so.

But, why?

And more important: Is it worth it?

When I was 15, I started my own personal blog. It was hosted on Blogger, and it was a collection of random, funny, and exciting stuff I stumbled upon. Nothing fancy. Yet, I loved two things:

First, that I enjoyed creating websites. Blogger had this ugly(?) XML-like language to tweak its blogs, but I felt mighty changing colors and sizes. 13 years later, here I am.

The second thing I loved _(and right to the point of this post, focus Adrià goddammit)_ was that I _knew_ stuff because I had shared them. I was aware of new things, and I remembered them because I took the time of writing them down and creating the post.

This feeling was powerful. Do you mean I get to do what I like **while** learning interesting stuff? Shut up and take my money (I was 15, so yeah, good luck taking _all_ my money).

I’ve had several blogs afterward (Geeks.cat, that disappeared. And now [this one](https://afontcu.dev)). The idea, however, remained the same: **forcing yourself to share and explain something is the best way to learn it**. I’d go even further: the only way of truly knowing something is checking if you are able to explain it using simple words.

I have changed the format (I've given [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbz-S_jILD8) [conference talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNI8rZ4l-5Q)). The format is not important. A blog, a short talk, a video, a podcast, an answer to an online forum, whatever. As long as you share, you improve.

The goal shouldn’t be “to reach as many people as possible”. That’s a quite lovely side effect. Yet, the goal should be to help your future self.

## Start simple

Do you read cool stuff online? Share it on your team’s Slack, on Twitter. [Curate a post list](https://calidae.blog/tagged/food-for-thought) and publish it (it’s so damn easy).

The wheel never stops turning.

Then, you might see the benefit of explaining something. It could be a short blog post, a code snippet shared on Codesandbox, a cool design on Dribbble, a lightning talk in your company.

And this, folks, is the main reason behind this blog and my newsletter. It’s just another channel I wanted to explore. The goal is just growing.

Go for it.
