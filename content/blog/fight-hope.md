Software development is not about hope.

Agile, and everything related, is about killing hope. Projects do not succeed based on hope.

Management might (for a while).

Software development should be about destroying hope.

## This feature…

"…will give us 10% more sales".

"…will give us 10% less support tickets".

"…will give us 10% faster invoice generation".

I'm here to fight the "will" part.
