Everything boils down to shortening the feedback loops.

But what's actually feedback loop?


Feedback loops are good, so we should have as much of them as possible.

A unit test is a feedback loop – the shortest one I could think of.

An integration test, whatever that means, is a slightly bigger one.


This is what software is about.
