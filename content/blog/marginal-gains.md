At the same time (no pun intended), we underestimate a long-term process of improvement.

It's pure maths.

Imagine what it would take for you to improve any process, anything that comes to your mind, by a 20%. 20% faster, 20% safer, 20% better. Any process, any activity, any outcome.

I'll go ahead that's not trivial, and that it's hard to tweak the right pieces.

Instead, what would it take to improve 1%?

Is it feasible?

Cool. Do it.

Tomorrow, improve it by another 1%.

Then do it again. And again.

You know what will be the improvement in a year?

```bash
1.01 ^ 365 = 37.78
```

That's right. In a year, you'll be a 37% better.

That's why continuous improvement works, and it is worth the effort. It's tricky because you need to keep finding potential improvements, and you also need not to go back to previous states.

However, it pays off.

Also, it's easier to find how to improve a 1%. You already know what sucks – you just need to improve it a bit. A bit! There's no need to fix it up for good. Embrace better over perfect.
