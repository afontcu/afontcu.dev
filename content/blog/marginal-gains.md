At the same time (no pun intended), we underestimate a long-term process of improvement.

## It's pure maths

First, think of any process you'd like to improve

Say… time-to-market in a given company. Or % of churn. Or lead time for a given team. Or average speed in a 100km bicycle ride.

Imagine you want to improve any of them by a 20%. 20% faster, 20% safer, 20% better, whatever. Any process, any activity, any outcome.

Nope. Isn't gonna be easy.

## Compounding effects

What would it take to improve by 1% instead?

Can you think of a 1% improvement for a bicycle ride, fo

It sure looks more doable to me.

Tomorrow, improve it by another 1%. Then do it again. And again.

Imagine you kept doing that by a year.

1.01<sup>365</sup> = **37.78**

That's right. By improving a 1% daily, that process would become 37% better/faster/stronger in a year.

That right there is a compound effect: any future improvement is built upon the previous ones. Do not underestimate a 1% improvement.

## But but but

I can hear you screaming "but…!" . We definitely assumed a couple of interesting facts, here:

First of all, we assume you'd keep improving every single day. This is tricky not only by the required commitment, but also because you need to find daily small, viable improvements.

It sounds daunting because it is.

However, what's the alternative? Good look finding a great, **actionable**, realistic good idea that improves anything by 37% at once.

More often than not, an improvement that big will not exist.

Also, it's easier to find those small improvements. In fact, you probably now some of them already! Those small things that could help you get closer to the desired outcome.

## Better over perfect

Let's face it: a 1% improvement is not that exciting. It might feel like *nothing*.

However, it pays off. It's maths! Maths do never lie.

The key here is to nail that 1% every day, continuously. And reflect.
