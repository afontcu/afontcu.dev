standing on the shoulders of giants

discovering truth by building on previous discoveries

perspective is everything.

i was in this meetup with my friend and former colleague Xavi when he mentioned
that someone saw me as a "really senior engineer" (whatever that means).

It's funny because I try to look up to people I can learn from. This is positive,
but it also leads to the imposter syndrome. It is easy to end up swallowed by
the feeling of not being good enough, not focusing enough, not learning enough.
There's always something else to learn, and there's always someone better at it.

It is a double-edged sword.

It might lead to burnout, and we should take that into account.

Take it easy.

You can't learn everything. You don't need that, either.
