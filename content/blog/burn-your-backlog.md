"*Wow*!", one might say. "*You really put some effort into gathering all these ideas*!", they might add. "*It is great that you have everything figured out – your next steps, the following features, the priorities set. I love the confidence this backlog irradiates*", a stakeholder might conclude.


## Ideas are cheap

We overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.

Anybody can suggest **expensive and complicated solutions**. It takes work and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small time box.

A backlog is a list of promises we made to ourselves. Stuff we agreed upon several months ago. That stupid feature a stakeholder requested and you'll never prioritize because, honestly, who would.

Why would you spend time on storing stuff you will never do?

## Talk doesn't cook rice

Backlogs are time-consuming. They require refinement, triage, updating, asking that person whose team is gone what was that bug report about…

And then, oh yes, you *prioritize* them.


## Let it go

Ask yourself – what's the backlog helping you achieve? A backlog only stresses people out. "We'll never get all this shit done!". No, of course you won't! A backlog is like a gift list: a collection of lost hopes, random ideas, one-time bugs, useless stuff.


## Clean sheet

In a (good) feedback loop, each iteration feeds you with information for the following one.

Otherwise, well, it's not a feedback loop. It is running in circles.

With that information, the appropriate context, and the right people, you can work towards your goal without having a list of 150 (cheap) ideas.
