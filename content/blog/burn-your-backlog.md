"*Wow*!", one might say. "*You really put some effort into gathering all these ideas*!", they might add. "*It is great that you have everything figured out – your next steps, the following features, the priorities set. I love the confidence this backlog irradiates*", a stakeholder might conclude.


## Ideas are cheap

It’s easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.

Anybody can suggest expensive and complicated solutions. It takes work and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small time box

A backlog is a list of promises we made to ourselves. Stuff we agreed upon several months ago. That stupid feature a stakeholder requested and you'll never prioritize because, honestly, who would.

## Talk doesn't cook rice

Backlogs are time-consuming. You refine them. You triage features, old tickets, stuff you honestly don't know who put there.

And then, oh yes, you *prioritize* them.

## Clean sheet

In a feedback loop, each iteration feeds you with information for the following one.

Otherwise, well, it's not a feedback loop. It is running in circles.

With that information, the appropriate context, and the right people, you can work towards your goal without having a list of 150 (cheap) ideas.
