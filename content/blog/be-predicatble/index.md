If I wanted a team to be better, i’d ask them to be **predictable**.

"*What does "predictable" even mean, Adri?*" you might ask.

Well, I'm not a dictionary. I understand predictability as the ability to **produce a stable flow of value** per unit of time by spending a similar amount of resources.

to do so, they’d need to keep costs stable, too.

transaction costs
development costs
opportunity costs

Keeping costs stable require an investment. Our software and infrastructure degrades constantly (yeah, folks, I'm talking about entropy), so we need to actively keep it clean and shiny.

It is like a restaurant: you cannot keep on serving menus without cleaning up the kitchen.


## The larger the feature, the harder to be predictable

So the only way to be predictable is to **keep things small**. No, no *that* small. Smaller. Smaller. Now we're talking.

It is hard to have a variable flow when things are kept small. When we take less time to deliver something, there's less opportunities for shit to happen.

Keep things short so unexpected events can't mess with them.

Also, being wrong on a large batch is expensive. On the other hand, if you fuck up a small feature, well, it is not that bad.

<!-- Some costs are linear: updating a 500-item list is more or less linearly more expensive than updating a 50-item list. Not to mention that sometimes costs are exponential (communications, for example). -->

Large batches are fragile because we have more to lose than to gain in the presence of disorder. And disorder shine in our world: time, uncertainty, lack of knowledge, and errors, among others, pile up to make our industry both challenging and exciting.

## Wrapping up

Having a predictable team is good for the team itself and also for the business. It's a team you can rely on and that it works to improve its environment.

The only way a team can be predictable is by **working on small batches**, by **finishing stuff before starting other stuff**, and by focusing relentlessly on **improving** the overall system.
