If I wanted a team to be better, I’d ask them to be **predictable**.

*"What does 'predictable' even mean, Adri?"* you might ask.

I'm not a dictionary but I'll try to answer.

I understand predictability as the ability to improve the ratio between **a sustainable flow of value** and the amount of resources used to achieve it.

To do so, they’d need to keep costs stable. You know: development costs, infrastructure costs, maintenance costs, opportunity costs…

Keeping costs stable require an investment. Our software and infrastructure degrades constantly (yeah, folks, I'm talking about [software entropy](https://agilepearls.wordpress.com/tag/software-entropy/)), so we need to **actively keep it clean and shiny**.

It is like a restaurant: you can't keep on serving menus without cleaning up the kitchen. You can't offer innovative dishes if you don't sharpen your skills.


## The larger the feature, the harder to be predictable

So the only way to be predictable is to **keep things small**. No, no *that* small. Smaller. Smaller. Now we're talking.

It is hard to have a variable flow when things are kept small. Things tend to run smoothly. When we take less time to deliver something, there's less opportunities for shit to happen.

Keep things short so unexpected events can't mess with them.

Also, being wrong on a large batch is expensive. On the other hand, if you fuck up a small feature, well, it is not that bad.

Large batches are **fragile** because we have more to lose than to gain in the presence of disorder. And disorder shine in our world: time, uncertainty, lack of knowledge, and errors, among others, pile up to make our industry both challenging and exciting.


## Wrapping up

Writing software is [the best way to deliver value in a sustainable pace](https://afontcu.dev/goal-of-software-development/).

Having a **predictable team** is good for the team itself and also for the business. It's a team you can rely on. It will also keep improving its environment and others might benefit.

The only way to make a team predictable is to **work on small batches**, **finish stuff before starting new one**, and to focus relentlessly on **improving** the overall system.

Oh, and some [stability](https://afontcu.dev/power-to-the-teams/) won't hurt.


## But… Adri. How do I know if my team is predictable or not?

Oh, my friend. You're entering the realm of the **metrics of flow**. We'll get into that soon enough – stay tuned!
