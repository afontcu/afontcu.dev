"Do whatever you feel like doing". This is autonomy. It sounds good.

But.

Autonomy can also get you running in circles.

## The baseline

This one is easy – to avoid running in circles, a team (or group of teams) need a shared vision, a goal.

Alignment is the stepping stone that enables autonomy. Without it, the result is apathy.

## The paradox

One might think about autonomy as the absence of constraints or limitations.

And I grant you that – having constraints sounds "bad".

We tend to blame constraints when things don't go as expected.

Yet, I try to challenge this assumption and frame them as challenges.

What would a group of people or a group of teams look like when **granted with autonomy**, but also **with no constraints**?

*(Yes, I actually drew this on a post-it. I was in the middle of a totally unrelated conversation so I had to pretend like I was listening).*

## Constraints

Mark Twain once said "*I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead*".

David Ogilvy once said "*Give me the freedom of a tight brief*".

(These quotes might be fake. I didn't check).

When the surface area for exploration is limited, it promotes focus on the most important problem.

It is **the art of simplicity**: focus only on the important stuff. Do less things.

Do what's actually important. Take away all the irrelevance.

Also, you'll need some slack time so that you can define (and refine) more constraints. You can not have a system mindset with your head stuck in the ground.

This is why starting an essay from a blank page is so damn hard.

### Gimme some examples

Dunno, mate. It depends on your context. Here are some random ideas:

**#1**: deploy software to production every working day.

**#2**: all code should be developed in pairs.

**#3**: a team can only be working in 2 different things at the same time.

**#4**: any git branch older than two days should be merged or deleted.

**#5**: assume all your users have a shitty internet connection.

**#6**: any web application should load in less than 2 seconds.

## Expanding constraints

There's a flaw, though, with fixed constraints: We never get people (or teams) back if they lose track.

There's no common ground, no baseline where we all agree upon. No way to get back.

What if constraints were incremental, like a cone?

[postit cono]

Some of them are basic, fundamental. Non-negotiable. Some are built upon each other, so they allow for more range of motion once the person (or the team) feels comfortable enough. They can be iterated.

## Too long; didn't read

Autonomy is something worth fighting for.

Autonomy requires vision. It also requires constraints.

Get freedom by having focus. And if you are one of those people who lead/manage: Give freedom by giving focus.
