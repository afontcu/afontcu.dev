Someone was really happy with us ("us" as in "my team") last week.

Turns out we deployed a contrived new version of a form they were using. Among other stuff, there was an input to introduce a bank account number. A single input where you could paste the number from somewhere else.

How exciting, a form with an input.

We didn't know back then, but previously our users had to introduce the same number but splitting it in several input fields. So they would copy the account number into notepad, split it into groups, and then paste it back to our form.

t-w-e-n-t-y-f-i-r-s-t c-e-n-t-u-r-y, my friends.

The form contained other goodies, but that blew up.

## Hey, but you didn't know

That's true, and that's a shame. We should have known better. We should've been aware of such an issue waaay before.

And the only way I can think of is to sit down next to them.

Imagine knowing that in advance. Imagine realizing that your software is forcing users to do such a stupid thing as manually splitting a damn bank account number.

Would you say that's a **software increment** worth developing and deploying?

(The answer is yes).

## A small increment

Yeah, we added a better text input.

That piece of code is not gonna end up in a museum. Such museum would need to feature reaaally weird stuff, to be honest.

Yet, **we helped someone**. You know when we folks say "whatever whatever providing value to users"? Well, this is it.

I work at Holaluz. I don't sell energy, I don't manage clients. I'd suck at selling, I'd suck at managing (not only) clients. My only skill, if any, is to create software to let people do such activities.

We made someone's life a bit better. This is why we (software developers) were here in the first place.

We delivered a **small increment**.

Was that enough? Well, that really depends on your definition of "enough".

Is the app done? Not for a bit.

Was it an "integrated, running, tested version of the software" ([that's a quote](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/017-08ff/new-framework-increment))? It was.

Did it feel good? Lol you bet, I even ended up writing a newsletter issue about it.

I mean, it took me more to come up with this text than to develop that stupid back account input field.

## Bottom line

Small things do provide value.

So, keep things small. No, not *that* small. Smaller. Smaller I said. Break stuff until you can do it in... a day, or two.

Then do it. Test it. Integrate it. Deploy it. Check it is useful to someone. Then focus on the next small (noooo, smaller!) item on the list.
