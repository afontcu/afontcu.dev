technical debt --> deliberate decision to implement worse solutions (rushing software to prove some experiment is a good idea).

making bad solutions and not being aware of bad code is not technical debt – it is bad code.

When deliberately making a decision, you agree on:
* Cutting corners.
* Paying it back – potentially with interests.

mistakes
deliberate experiment = no matter if you success or not – you've learned something either way
this is quite different from non-deliberate experiments: a mistake. That feeling when you fuck up something and then say "At least we learned [...]". That's not the same thing.

deliver less, but deliver more often.


do not aim for finished

leave your developer pride aside

There's always something you can remove.

**Software development is an iteration game**.

You're finding the best combination of **effort** and **provided value**.

A shitton of effort is hard to match. No value is also meaningless.

## Vertically over horizontally

Cool designs in Figma are cool. Nice rounded corners. Amaze drop shadows.

Amazing database schemas are amazing. Wow, such foreign key. Amaze triggers.

The design might be perfect. So might the schema.

None of them are done. None of them are… valuable by themselves.

feedback loops curts

You end up solving problems sooner. It also lets you learn sooner, too. If you slice a feature really thin, you might learn that iteration #2 is enough, and then move on to the next important thing.

## But it will be done, eventually

Sure. It will.

Let me quote Kent Beck here – the occasion has yet to come where I'm able to express something better than Mr. Beck:

"*Alternative to estimates: do the most important thing until either it ships or it is no longer the most important thing*". ([source](https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/634741725047615489))

I'd humbly add "or until someone stops paying you money for".
