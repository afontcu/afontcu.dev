## I write about testing

In the past weeks I've written several articles about testing:

* [Front-end Testing and a tale of three users](https://afontcu.dev/frontend-testing-code-consumers/)

* [Creating a culture of testing](https://afontcu.dev/culture-of-testing/)

* [Testing API calls in Vue applications](https://afontcu.dev/testing-api-calls/)

As explained in [Learning in public](https://afontcu.dev/learning-in-public/), I feel that writing stuff _to your future self_ is a great way of learning. Write the post you wish you had found two months ago.

For example, today's post is going to remember my future self that there are severals ways of learning. It's also gonna be a great reminder that you can learn from almost everything if you have the right mindset.

## I speak about testing

For me, speaking is one of the best learning tools out there. If I'm gonna be in front of people talking about stuff, I better get my shit together.

It's a win-win situation: I get to talk in front on people and get some credit for the work I do, but I also end up exploring a topic deep enough for it to become second nature.

Imposter syndrome will still kick in, but at least I'll get the most of the experience. :shrug:

I take every opportunity I have: internal talks, [local meetups](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/edreamjs-frontend-dev-tech-talk-tickets-61779463037#tickets), the [Vue JS Roadtrip](http://vuejsroadtrip.com/barcelona), and soon I'll be spreading the word at [JS Day](https://jsdaycanarias.com/) in Canarias and [CommitConf](https://2019.commit-conf.com/) in Madrid.

## I read about testing

Reading, watching videos, and in general, consuming content, is obviously a great way to stay on top of anything. For me, [Testing Javascript](https://testingjavascript.com/) course was a game changer 

## I... well, write tests

As much as possible. Learn by doing.

## I get involved in a testing community

One of the things that got me hooked into testing was the Testing Library approach. Keeping things as close as possible to the end user, staying away from implementation details, and providing a clear, succint API. Make it easy, make it quick, and most importantly, make it useful.

The Testing Library ecosystem relies on DOM Testing Library as its foundational piece, from where other libraries grow. React/Vue/Cypress Testing Library are "ports"

I found that Vue Testing Library was active and 

## I envagelize testing as much as possible

Discussing a topic with other people will produce interesting results. Some people might agree with you, so you know your ideas .

But even more interesting is when someone doesn't align with your views. That's a great opportunity to understand their use cases, and revisit your beliefs.
