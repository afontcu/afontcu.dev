Remember that meeting where you had a great idea. You thought of a way to improve a topic in your job. Or even better, a solution to an ongoing problem, something you knew need to be addressed.

So, during the meeting, you explain your great idea. It‚Äôs so damn clear inside your head! Yet, you don‚Äôt get the buy-in. Or even worse: some say ‚Äúfine‚Äù, but nothing happens in the following days.

Have you ever lived a similar experience?

Yeah, who doesn‚Äôt, right?

Thing is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I discovered it the hard way- **a problem existing is not enough reason to trigger action towards solving it**.

‚Äú_What?_‚Äù you might say. ‚Äú_If I have a problem and someone offers me a solution, you bet I would implement it!_‚Äù.

Well, that‚Äôs not true. Sorry about that.

You identify a big problem. You find a quite well-crafted solution. You try to sell it to people who, allegedly, suffer the issue. And Bam!‚Ä¶ Nothing happens.

### Mental models behind convincing people

Mental _what_?

A [mental model](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) is a mental representation of how everything works‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour mind, ourselves, the World, everything. We use models to help us represent the actual reality surrounding us. We need to simplify it and come up to a bite-sized version of that reality.

So, every model is inherently wrong. But, as the aphorism says, **all models are wrong but some are useful**.

They are so powerful everyone should be aware of them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääafter all, we use them. All the time. The key difference is knowing you do so and using it to your advantage.

The power behind mental models is that **they are applied to several fields of knowledge**. They come from an economics, physics, biology, philosophy, whatever. But they can be easily mapped into other disciplines.

So, let‚Äôs explore what they say about convincing people.

### MAT

During my time as a member of an online marketing team, I learned about this model called ‚ÄúMAT‚Äù, created by [Dr. Fogg](https://www.bjfogg.com/). It states the following:

> In order for a behavior to happen, three conditions must be fulfilled.  
> A **motivation** to do the behavior, the **ability** to do so, and a **trigger** that _triggers_ the action. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing.

So we need three ingredients.

We need some **trigger** to put everything in motion. This trigger could be anything. In software, think of a bug that takes a team several hours to fix. A lost project for a misunderstanding. The announcement of someone leaving. Things that might make you want to change something.

**Ability** refers to the individual being able to actually do something to fix it. The easier the thing, the more likely the thing will get done. You need a lot of motivation (or a hell of a trigger) to start something that requires a lot of effort. Yet, an easier task will likely happen, even with a less powerful trigger or motivation.

Finally, you need some **motivation** to start the whole process.

And talking about _motivation_‚Ä¶

### Driving people

This made me think of something else. When I read [Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805), by Dan Pink, ([one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read](https://calidae.blog/qu%C3%A8-ens-motiva-9c1c9e3e6bd3). Period) I learned about the intrinsic motivators that make us stand up and do things.

Pink identifies 3 basic intrinsic modifiers:

*   The willingness to **master** our craft.
*   The **autonomy** of doing what we think is best, the way we think is best.
*   The **purpose** of the task we want to do.

_(Remember that Pink talks about intrinsic motivators. An extrinsic motivator would be getting paid or, well, not getting hit with a whip)_.

So as long as you want to change someone else‚Äôs behavior, and not only _force_ them to do something, you should have intrinsic motivators in mind. And sell them as incentives.

Talking about _incentives_‚Ä¶

### Selling a Design¬†System

Reading [Smashing Magazine #6](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/smashing-book-6-release/) book (a must read, if I may), the first chapter caught my eye. [Laura Elizabeth](https://twitter.com/laurium) writes there about Design Systems, and how to ‚Äúsell‚Äù them to both your colleagues and people with resources (a.k.a. money and time) to finance the project.

She points to three main topics that need to be addressed to get a buy-in from the stakeholders:

1.  **Resources**. What will we _need_ to put things in motion and support them all along the way?
2.  **Incentives**. What are the potential _benefits_ of a Design System?
3.  **Consequences**. What will happen if we _don‚Äôt adopt_ a Design System?

I don‚Äôt want to spoil the whole text Laura wrote (read the book üòú), but what she described as _consequences_ reminded me of [Cost of Opportunity](http://www.thinkmentalmodels.com/page40/page46/page46.html). See what I did there? _Another mental model has joined the room_.

Imagine that someone offers you to two envelopes with money, one containing twice as much as the other one. Don‚Äôt worry, this is not the [Two Envelopes Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem).

You might pick whatever envelope you want, and I‚Äôm quite sure your mind will start doubting. ‚Äú_Hey, folk. You sure about this? Don‚Äôt you want to pick the other one? We might not be winning the bigger pot!_‚Äù. That‚Äôs our mind being played by the cost of opportunity.

Bear in mind the cost of _not_ adopting an idea/tool/whatever, not only the direct benefits of doing so.

You see, **I love when ideas add up and sustain each other like a latticework**. We talked about online marketing, psychology, and design systems. We combined learnings from several sources and ended up seeing that they all boil down to basic principles.

All this exploration reminded me of [First Principles mental model](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/). Philosophy over here, now.

This is the power of mental models. Simple but powerful frames that you use as **building blocks to create more complex ideas**. Same thing we do nowadays to create User Interfaces using VueJS or React. _What?_ _Connecting the dots again?_

Have you ever noticed any other pattern that you might use in several knowledge fields?
