Except when they are.

You read books, posts, watch videos, whatever, and that's cool. But the true power comes from matching these learnings with personal experiences.

Recently, I experienced a match between theory<sup>1</sup> and reality. And oh, you bet it felt good.

## Fear-inducing gaps

I noticed how fear appeared when one of the following gaps was so evident and dangerous that someone eventually took action:

### The gap between what you'd like to know and what you actually know

What do we do to mitigate this fear? Well, we request more detailed information.

We want to be on top of everything.

We confuse understanding with information.

### The gap between what you want people to do and what they actually do

We tend to overcome this fear by providing more detailed instructions. We tell people exactly what to do.

We move from agreeing on "why", or even "what", to suggesting "how".

We confuse clarity and alignment with detail.

### The gap between the expected results of actions and what they actually achieve

When this happens, we tend to ask for more reporting. What have you been doing? How are you going to organize today? What are you spending your time with?

We confuse [outcomes with outputs](https://afontcu.dev/ways-telling-problem-oriented/).

## Gaps

Did you notice the trend in these gaps? We close them by **taking a step back** and seize more power and control. We sacrifice autonomy, trust, and empowerment.

It is obvious that **we need to close the gaps**. Mostly because in a gap, information is lost, and more coordination is required. Overhead emerges.

If there's a gap, you'll need to build a bridge.

To sacrifice trust, quality, and all we agreed upon only to close a gap, feels like a high price to pay.

From the outside, it may look like **you've never believed in these things in the first place**.

It may look like they are replaceable. Something not worth standing up for. A *nice to have*.

## Feel related yet?

I'm afraid (pun intended) there's no silver bullet to finish this post with. I wish there was!

All I can tell is that these gaps resonated with me several times.

So, my bet is that you, fellow reader, have been through the same. My only suggestion is to be aware of this. Identify which gap you are trying to close – and, more importantly, your requests to "build the bridge" to shut down fear.

Here's an idea, though. "When things derail, you might want to go [back to basics](https://afontcu.dev/back-to-basics/)".

<sup>1</sup>: these ideas around "fears" or "gaps" are not an invention of mine – obviously. I've learned about them in [Escaping the Build Trap](https://melissaperri.com/book) and [The Art of Action](https://www.stephenbungay.com/Books).
