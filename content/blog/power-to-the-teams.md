Teams should be the core, base entity of an organization.

Teams should be trully cross-functional: all needed roles should be there – and when I say all, I mean all – not only coding.

Software teams should focus on producing running, working, and tested code as soon as possible (every two weeks better than two months, every two days better than two weeks).

The software should be clean, its design should be simple, so that it can evolve freely. The team should always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. It should refactor relentlessly.

Teams should hold product conversations. The customer should be there. If not possible, a customer advocate (say, a Product Owner) is a nice, usual alternative.

Teams should be stable. There's sooo much benefit in having an intact team over a period of time, where accountability, ownership, and predictability grows. It is the only way I've seen to make it run like a well-oiled machine. Stable teams over project teams.

Teams should not forget the big picture. They do not live in isolation – there will be other teams, other goals. Yet, it should be on team's should to figure out the best way to help the organization to move forward. Every time a decision is forced on a team, its autonomy wears out quickly.

Do this, or do the exact opposite. Take it with a grain of salt.
