Teams should be the core entity. The primary unit of work within an engineering team.

Teams should be cross-functional: **all needed roles should be there** – and when I say all, I mean every role – not only coding. The customer should be there. If not possible, a customer advocate (say, a Product Owner) is a valid, common alternative.

## The Software

**Software teams should focus on producing running, working, and tested code as soon as possible.**

Every week better than every month, every day better than every week. Every hour better than every day. [As. Soon. As. Possible](https://afontcu.dev/feedback-loops/).

The value provided through delivered software should be aligned with **whatever goal the team is trying to achieve**. Teams should have product-focused conversations. Getting closer to goals in a sustainable pace should be the center of every discussion.

The software should be clean, its design should be simple so that it can evolve freely. The team should always design and code for today and not for tomorrow. Refactor should occur relentlessly. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

## The Stability

They should be stable. There's sooo much benefit in having a stable team over a period of time. This is where accountability, ownership, and **predictability** grows. It is the only time I've seen a team run like a well-oiled machine. Stable teams over project teams.

Does it mean teams should never change? No, it doesn't.

Does it mean team stability should be a top priority? From my point of view, it should.

Does it mean teams should have a voice when decisions are made about the team itself? Oh, folks, yes it does. Sure it does. A team's autonomy diminishes after each imposed decision.

I'd rather have a team change goals rather than split its members apart.

## The Big Picture

Teams should not forget the big picture. They do not live in isolation – there might be other teams, other goals, urgencies. Yet, they should be the ones figuring out the best way to help the organization move forward.

Make sure they have a **purpose**, enough **autonomy**, and hunger for **mastery**.

Set expectations and **constraints**, and let teams figure out the best possible way. Bear in mind that it doesn't happen overnight.
