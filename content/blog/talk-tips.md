Last year I had the chance to give my "Maintainable & scalable CSS" talk in a couple of events: [Barcelona Crafters](https://softwarecrafters.barcelona/2018/index.html) and [Commit 2018](https://2018.commit-conf.com/). In both conferences, I had a 45-minute slot to fill in with my personal experience managing CSS.

That was cool. Same talk, similar time slot (40 vs 45 min). I was expecting to use **the exact same speech and slides**. You might call it "ROI optimization".

However, in between both events, I was invited to speak at [Modern Web Event](https://mosaic.uoc.edu/modern-web-event/) by La UOC. There, I had the chance to talk about (drumroll...) [maintainable and scalable CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRQXaq-uCSc).

## There was only one problem 
I had to shrink my talk to fit it into a 25-min slot.

It looked like killing your own son (wild guessing here - I've never killed any).

The result, though, is that I ended up with a better talk. A waaay better one. I kinda knew the topic by the time of shrinking it, so it was easy to decide what was worth explaining, and what was utterly needless.

So, after that, **instead of going back to the original one** for the Commit Conf, I decided to keep the 25 min version and work from there.

I feel that the talk I gave at Commit is way better than the first 45-min version I created.

## History repeats itself

It just happened again last week. I was prepping my talk for the [VueJS Roadtrip BCN](https://vuejsroadtrip.com/barcelona/) event. There, I'll have 35 minutes to explain and discuss some things about testing the front end.

Before that event, I also got invited to take part at the [Front end Dev Tech Talk](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/edreamjs-frontend-dev-tech-talk-tickets-61779463037), organized by eDreams.

The topic? <s>Maintainable and scal</s> just kidding. **Testing the front end**.

Time slot? 15 minutes. _Fif-teen_!

The outcome? Well, kinda expected by now. I ended up being **way happier** with the 15-min version than the longer one. After collecting some feedback, I decided to improve some details here and there and explain better some examples. That was it.

## So, to whom it may concern
I discovered that I feel more satisfied if I **prepare my talk to be 50-60% shorter than it really is**.

Then, I keep adding details, improvements, small fixes. Let it breathe.

Next time, try it out. You'll have focused on the core parts of your topic.

And it comes with additional benefits: if you do it right, you'll know that you're not "in a rush" and you won't be forcing 200 slides down everybody's throat.
