In a perfect world, you'd face charges for writing untested code.

Buuut we are not there yet.

We all "know" testing is important.

But...

## "...but it is hard"

If your code is hard to test, it's because it's **doing too much**.

If it's doing too much, it's also **hard to understand**.

If it's hard to understand, it's also **hard to maintain**.

And one could argue that **unmaintainable code is not _good_ code**.

If testing hurts, we tend to blame the test. Usually, though, the root cause is the code being tested.

In short: Testing highlights pieces of code that could use a [redesign](https://practicingruby.com/articles/refactoring-is-not-redesign). Assume that something that feels "hard to test" is **poorly designed**.

## "...but we're late, we need to deliver this feature ASAP"

The G in ASAP stands for "Good idea".

Let me get this straight. If you donâ€™t have time to do it right, **when will you have time to do it over?**

Skip testing, and you'll find yourself dealing with defects and poor quality. You will end up dying by reworks and having your Product Owner talking your ear off.

Testing plays a considerable role when it comes to code quality. And we already know that [high-quality software is actually cheaper to produce](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html). We do, right? If the answer is no, go and read the linked article above. Pure gold.

**Writing tested code is faster than writing untested code** (after the short initial slow down).

## "...but don't worry, we are adding them later"

Hahaha, lie. You are not gonna add them (and you know it).

The feature is live, and you have moved on to the next one. Ain't nobody got time for that anymore! After all, code's already in production. Most of its bugs are gone thanks to daily usage feedback. Bugs that tests might have avoided, but whatever.

Also, adding tests afterward is **way harder** than doing it while writing the feature. Way harder.

And remember that **testing is a great design tool**. Test _while_ developing a feature is a great way to come up with a maintainable, better-designed codebase.
