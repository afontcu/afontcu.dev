In a perfect world, the lack of testing is what should require justification. Buuut we are far from there.


## "But my code is hard to test"

But but but.

If your code is hard to test, then it's probably **doing too much**.

If it's doing too much, it's probably **hard to understand**.

If it's hard to understand, it's **hard to maintain**.

And one could argue that **unmaintainable code is not good code**.

Put it that way: Testing higlights pieces of code that could use some refactor. If a test inflicts pain, we tend to blame the test - even when the root cause is in the code's design.
